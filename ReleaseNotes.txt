1.     Update test stations 1 to 3 cfg files for JYT reported 42.00 issues

3/12/2020 NP Rev 1.6
Changes in this release are:-
1.	Update Calibration algorithms for:
	a.	improvement of NUM2 failure issue
	b.	improvement of ToF tuning
	c. 	improvement of Edge Cropping
	d. 	improvement of Contrast Cluster Check

2.	Update Temperature Check
	Add a user configurable upper limit for sensor temperature.

	Give BinCode 10.04 back to error Temp Reg Reading = 0

3.     Update cfg files for tuning improvements
	- Rename the cfg files into Generic Flex cfgs for Test Stations 1 - 3 and Specific Module cfgs for Test Stations 4 - 7.

1/9/2020 NP Rev 1.5
Changes in this release are:-
1. Update Encryption Block Check function MT_Chk_Encrypt
        -  Add Full Image Encryption-Decryption & Verify step
           Run an Image with Encryption and then Decryption & Verify to make sure the whole Encryption block is running good
           Failure BinCode 21.34
        -  Add BinCode for Encryption Session Close failure
           Failure BinCode 21.35

2. Change Realtek buffer size to 10240 from 4096
        -  To work with the Full Image Encryption-Decryption & Verify step in encryption check

3. Change DMP FW to Ver 1.1.2 from 1.1.8
	-  To address the BIN Code: 60.04 issue

12/11/2019 NP Rev 1.4
Changes in this release are:-
1.  Exposure of LotID and WaferID in the MT_Chk_ASICID(PortCnt, DieID, WaferID, (char *)LotID),
	So that a unique ChipID can be formed from LotID+WaferID+DieID then

12/6/2019 NP Rev 1.3
Changes in this release are:-
1.  SN folder change
2.	Memory leakage issue fixed.
3.	Internal ToF Issue fixed.

12/4/2019 NP Rev 1.2
1. 	No more loopback as I told you before to set 

        //ContRun = std::cin.get();
        ContRun = '0';
2. 	SN change to 23 bytes and unsigned char *
	Format given as the example in the code.

       strcpy_s((char*)SN, MTSTRINGMAX, "8SJYAAE0023HJ1KSYMDSSSS");
3.  Each SN module will have its own log.csv and _Target.bmp
    with clear timing record if tested for multiple times.

11/21/2019 NP Rev 1.1
Changes in this release are:-
1. 	Encryption Check Added.
	i)	For Encryption: OpenSessionAllowed-Fail, it would be BIN Code: 21.32.
	ii)	For Encryption: IID_VerifySessionOpen-Fail, it would be BIN Code: 21.33.
NOTES:
    Along with this change, the setup has to be power-on and power-off after every single run of the module test.
    So we need to unplug & plug the USB cable for every single run now.
    Otherwise, weird BIN Code: 21.-1 would be observed for incorrect run.
